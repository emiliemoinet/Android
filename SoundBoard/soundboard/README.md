## About

This project is the last one of our degree's year. It's about creating an app wich allow to register and play sounds develloped in react-native.

Anyway, this app allows a user to create a soundboard, create one or more groups under that soundboard,
and record custom sounds using their device. These sounds can be saved and played back, for the ultimate
meme-inducing experience.

## Developing

This project uses the [Expo](https://expo.io) framework for scaffolding.

1. Make sure you install [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) and its related tooling
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory
3. Run `npm start` to bring up the Expo toolchain
4. Open the app on either an iOS Simulator or Android Emulator instance
